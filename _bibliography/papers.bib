	abstract = {Detecting and locating marine mammals is essential for understanding their behavior and supporting conservation efforts. Acoustic methods complement visual surveys and tagging, which are often limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Fin whales are particularly suited for acoustic monitoring due to their stereotypical 20 Hz vocalizations. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) offers a promising addition to hydrophone data, using fiber-optic cables as sensors for continuous, high-resolution monitoring over distances up to about 100 km. In November 2021, a DAS dataset was collected using the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array, capturing valuable data on fin whale vocalizations. This dataset includes measurements from two cables with 2 m channel spacing, spanning 65 -95 km. This study evaluates various approaches—including signal-to-noise ratio estimation, matched filtering, Gabor filtering, and noise envelope subtraction—for enhancing and denoising fin whale calls in DAS data. A method that combines matched filtering and envelope subtraction is most effective at detecting even low SNR fin whale calls and obtaining arrival times. Overall, this study highlights the potential of DAS array processing to significantly improve signal-to-noise ratios and enhance detection capabilities for monitoring fin whales.},

  abstract = {This manuscript investigates sound propagation modeling in forest environments, intending to understand the limitations ofexisting models and explore their potential bioacoustic applications. The subject is introduced by presenting current concernsabout the impact of noise on health and biodiversity. A literature review examines previous studies and existing outdoor soundpropagation models, both analytical and numerical, for their applicability to forest scenarios. Then, as a time-domain solver, theTransmission Line Matrix (TLM) model is thoroughly investigated, and the update of its theory allows for highlighting limitationswhen modeling outdoor long-range sound propagation. Numerical experiments are presented to quantify the subsequent errorsand limitations in the TLM model. The computational implications of modeling a significant number of points implied by largefrequency-distance ratios are discussed. Finally, some applications to model sound propagation within forests, with multipleimpedance boundary conditions, are presented, and a validation method is proposed through comparisons with in-situmeasurements at the Nouragues research station (French Guiana). Overall, this research contributes to the understanding ofhow to simulate sound propagation within forests and the potential practical applications that can arise from it.},

  abstract = {Numerical sound propagation models include a wide range of methods with their own advantages depending on the physical phenomena under consideration. Due to its low-order scheme characteristic, the transmission line matrix (TLM) model is considered for coarse modeling of sound fields in complex outdoor environments. However, the space-time integration scheme of the method is dispersive and affects the free-field predictions. This paper extends a previous study of the numerical dispersion effect on the acoustic pressure field. An ideal case with specular reflections on a perfectly reflective ground is considered to understand the limitations of the method. First, a reminder of the model boundary conditions for specular reflection is provided, and the corresponding analytical solution is introduced as a reference to evaluate the reliability of the model. Then, a numerical experiment is presented and performed for different sound source spectra. The result analysis shows that dispersion can induce misplaced interferences in the numerically simulated sound fields and the resulting errors are quantified in terms of sound pressure levels (SPL). Finally, an analytical comparison with a well-known finite difference numerical scheme gives a perspective on the TLM model performance regarding several applications.},

The stability analysis allows the numerical dispersion relation of the model to be formulated and the associated errors to be quantified.

To conclude, the results are analyzed, highlighting the effects of the propagation distance and the spectral distribution of the simulated sources.},

It underlines the simplifications made in solving the equation system for the PET and proposes a correction of the errors in the widespread version of the PET calculation routine. A comparison of the corrected model with a stringent solving of the equation system is made: as a result, the PET calculated after the original method introduces a bias of - 0.5 to + 2.3 [K] in the studied conditions (operative temperature, high mean radiant temperature and windy environments). The original vapour diffusion model is also examined and shows no dependency to the clothing level. The comparison with a state-of-the-art vapour transfer model exhibits a significant - 7 to + 2.6 [K] discrepancy with the corrected PET model in the aforementioned studied conditions. Links to the two versions of the code are provided in the appendix.},
