Two summers in a row, around 20 days each summer, I went hiking on the [HRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Randonn%C3%A9e_Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9enne), an 800km trail on the Franco-Spanish border that passes by beautiful 3000m peaks. The first edition was in 2020, starting from the Atlantic Ocean and reaching [Pico Aneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneto) (3404 m) and the second one in 2021, starting from the Mediterranean Sea and reaching [Pico Maladeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladeta) (3312 m).
